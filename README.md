# CuckooHashingHLS
HLS implementation of cuckoo hashing. Refer to paper : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7577355/

# Directory structure
- `src/hls/`  Contains the HLS implementation
- `src/bsv` Contains BSV implementation
- `bench/` Contains benchmarks of other KV-stores

# Source
1. Hash module
2. Search module
3. Execute module
4. Storage module

# Test Bench
1. Traffic generator (?)
2. Traffic checker (?)
3. Controller test bench


# Minutes of meeting

## 31st october
- Finished first cut implementation of insert, search, delete
- Now, burn the thing on an FPGA and test it.
- Make the test bench first `insert` a bunch of keys, then `search`, then `delete`
- Make sure that the test bench is not the bottleneck!
