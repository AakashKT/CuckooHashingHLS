# CuckooHashingHLS
HLS implementation of cuckoo hashing. Refer to paper : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7577355/

# Directory structure
- `src/hls/`  Contains the HLS implementation
- `src/bsv` Contains BSV implementation
- `bench/` Contains benchmarks of other KV-stores

# Source
1. Hash module
2. Search module
3. Execute module
4. Storage module

# Test Bench
1. Traffic generator (?)
2. Traffic checker (?)
3. Controller test bench


# Minutes of meeting

## 31st october
- Finished first cut implementation of insert, search, delete
- Now, burn the thing on an FPGA and test it.
- Make the test bench first `insert` a bunch of keys, then `search`, then `delete`
- Make sure that the test bench is not the bottleneck!

Oh my fucking god, Vivado's own tools don't detect their own serial
ports. Fix this using:

```
sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200 -8 -o
```

# HLS bugs / nits / nice to have features that dont exist
- Unable to create BRAM for fields such as `bool`, `int16`. The data buses
will be `8/16` bits long, with error:

```
[BD 41-241] Message from IP propagation TCL of /blk_mem_gen_7: set_property
error: Validation failed for parameter 'Write Width A(Write_Width_A)' for BD
Cell 'blk_mem_gen_7'. Value '8' is out of the range (32,1024) Customization
errors found on 'blk_mem_gen_7'. Restoring to previous valid configuration.
```

- I had an array of structs:

```cpp
struct S {
    bool b;
    int16 x;
    int16 y;
}
```

This gets generated as 3 ports for memory, of widths `1`, `16`, `16`. Ideally,
I wanted *one* port, of width `16+16+1=33`, for each struct value.
However, what was generated were three ports of widths `1`, `16`, and `16`
which I cannot connect to BRAM.

- **`data_pack` allows us to create one port of width `16+16+1=33`**

- Shared function names allocated on BRAM causes errors in synthesis:
```cpp
struct Foo {...};
void f (Foo conflict) {
    #pragma HLS interface bram port=conflict
}

void g (Foo conflict) {
    #pragma HLS interface bram port=conflict
}
```


- Enums causes compile failure in RTL generation  (commit `3c0d619039cff7a7abb61268e6c8bc6d250d8730`)
- `ap_int` causes compile failurre in RTL generation (commit `3c0d619039cff7a7abb61268e6c8bc6d250d8730`)
- `x % m` where `m != 2^k` is very expensive -- there must be faster encodings of modulus?
- How to share code between HLS and vivado SDK? I often wanted to share constant values between
  my HLS code and my Zynq code.


# SDAccel craziness
**[link to tutorial we were following](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2017_1/ug1028-sdsoc-intro-tutorial.pdf)**
- The executable is named `.exe` while it's actually an ELF executable (The SDAccel tutorials say it is called as `.elf`)
- the board is supposed to automatically boot into linux, which it does not. One is expected to call `bootd` manually (for "boot default") so it boots ito linux. (The SDAccel tutorials say it automatically boots into it)
- At this point, the SD card is unreadable. It took a bunch of time to figure out that the SD card needs to be mounted by us, and has the mount name `/dev/mmcblk0p1`. (The SDAccel tutorials say that it should be automatically mounted)
- At this point, we are unable to run `hashing.elf`. It dies with a truly bizarre error: `hashing.elf: command not found`. This is almost un-googleable, due to the fact that the same problem occurs when people don't have the correct file name.
- I rewrote `ls` with `hashing.elf` to see what would happen, because I conjectured that the shell was able to run `coreutils`. 
- This dies with a different error `ls: core not found`. I'd luckily seen this during my android days, and knew this was from busybox.
- This led me to google "busybox unable to execute executable", which led me to this [StackOverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1562071/how-can-i-find-which-elf-dependency-is-not-fulfilled) that clued me into the fact that the ELF interpreter is missing.
- When I discovered this, I wound up trying to understand how to get the right ELF interpreter. `readelf -l <exe name>` dumps out `[Requesting program interpreter: /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3]`. So, I bravely copied: `cp /lib/ld-linux.so.3 /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3`.
- Stuff is *still* broken, but I now get *useful* error messages:
```
zynq> /hashing.elf 
/hashing.elf: error while loading shared libraries: libxilinxopencl.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
At this point, clearly we have some linker issues (why does `xocc` not correctly statically link? What's up with it? Why does it expect it to be able to load a shared library? **WTF is happening**). do note that this is _not_ the way the process
is supposed to go according to the tutorial!  
- Of course, there's no static library version of `libxilinxopencl.so`, so that's a dead end. I'm completely unsure if the tutorial even makes sense. 
- This entire chain of debugging is full of luck.
